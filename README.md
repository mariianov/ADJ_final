# ADJ_final: Eurovision Song Contest country profiles
Hello! This is my final project for Advanced Data Journalism. I have created a Eurovision profile report for 52 countries that have ever participated in the song contest. 

You can now find answers to many questions you may not have known you had:
- How many times has your favorite country won? 
- How many times has it performed in the final round? 
- Who votes for your favorite country and who does it vote for in return? 

These and other insights are waiting for you in the country_reports folder.

You can find the raw data I started with and the cleaned "eurovision.csv" dataset I ended up working with in the data folder. My scripts are located in the scripts folder. 

Please feel free to reach out with any questions. I hope you have fun exploring my Eurovision profiles!
